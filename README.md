# üìñ **get_next_line - Reading from a file, line by line!**

## üöÄ **Project Overview**  
The project involves creating a function that can read from a file descriptor, and return one line at a time.  
It is exceptionally useful for parsing files, and generally good for separating a large chunk of text.  
`static variables` was a new concept to me while working with this project. To understand the concept of  
static variables, we need to understand the difference between stack and heap.  

#### Stack VS Heap
When a program is ran, memory is getting allocated, meaning some memory is getting reserved to store the  
data needed. This allocation can happen either on the stack or the heap.

A **stack allocation** is local, and only remains within the function scope. This means that once the function
finishes, the memory is automatically freed and the values can't be accessed anymore.

In a function like this:
```bash
void	stack_allocation_function_1(void)
{
	int	x = 42;
	printf("%i\n", x);
}

void	stack_allocation_function_2(void)
{
	printf("%i\n", x);
}
```
**In this example, the first function sets the value 42 to a variable x, but the second
function can't access it because it only exists within the first function.**

An essential part of my implementation of `ft_printf()` is the `va_start()`, `va_arg()` and `va_end()` macros
from the `stdarg.h` library. They are used for handling variable argument lists in functions.
- `va_start()` initializes a `va_list` variable to be used with `va_arg` and `va_end`. It must be called before accessing the variable arguments.
- `va_arg()` retrieves the next argument in the list. The type of the expected argument needs to be specified.
- `va_end()` cleans up the va_list when you are done with it. It should be called before the function returns.

The `ft_printf()` function is declared like this:
```bash
int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
```

#### Arguments of `ft_printf()`  
- `const char *` -- A string containing characters and/or type identifiers.  
- `...` -- An undefined amount of arguments, with undefined types.  

#### Return value of `ft_printf()`  
The return value for `ft_printf()` is an `int`, indicating **how many characters were printed**.  
It returns `-1` upon error.  

`ft_printf()` writes to the standard output, and is limited to handling the following conversions:
- `%c` Prints a single character.
- `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- `%i` Prints an integer in base 10.
- `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- `%%` Prints a percent sign.

#### Understanding `va_start()` in `ft_printf()`
The `const char *` is a string that can contain both text and type identifiers, like "%s", "%p", etc.  
By using the function `va_start()`, the **type identifiers** in `const char *` gets connected to the **data** `...`, which is stored in a `va_list`.  
- For example: `ft_printf("%i", 42);`  
- In this example, `const char *` is `%i` and `...` is `42`.
- What will be printed on the standard output: `42`.  

#### Understanding `va_arg()` in `ft_printf()`
The function `va_arg()` is used to iterate through the type identifiers and their respective data.  
In `ft_printf()` -> whenever a type identifier is found in `const char *`, it gets connected to the next argument in `...`.  
- For example: `ft_printf("Hello, world! My name is %s, and I am %i years old.\n", "Bob", 40);`  
- In this example, `const char *` is `"Hello, world! My name is %s, and I am %i years old.\n"`, and `...` is `"Bob"` and `40`.
- This essentially means that `%s` expands to `"Bob"`, and `%i` expands to `40`. 
- What will be printed on the standard output: `"Hello, world! My name is Bob, and I am 40 years old."`.  

#### Understanding `va_end()` in `ft_printf()`
When `const char *` has reached the `'\0'`, meaning it has reached its end, `va_end()` is called to clean up the `va_list`.

## üß∞ **Included Files**  
- The `ft_printf.c` file containing the `ft_printf()` function, and the remaining `*.c` files containing all the printing functions for the different types.
- A `Makefile`.
- A header file.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Cloning the Repository**

To get started, first clone the repository.
This command will clone the repo, and move you to the right directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/busedame/ft_printf/ ft_printf && cd ft_printf
```
---

## üñ•Ô∏è **How to Compile and Run**  

1. **Compile the library**:  
	Run the following command to compile the library:  
	```bash
	make
	```
	This simply compiles the library, but does **not** make an executable.
2. **Test the function**:
	- Either use the existing main function in `ft_printf.c` (needs to be commented out), or add a `main.c` file with a new main function.
	- Compile using this command:
	```bash
	cc *.c -o ft_printf
	```
 	- Run using this command:
	```bash
	./ft_printf
 	```

## üîó**Including ft_printf in your project**

Ensure that you have both your main project and the `ft_printf` library in the same directory or organized in separate directories. You will need the path to your `ft_printf` directory to link it in the `Makefile`.

- **In the header file**: Include `ft_printf.h`

- **In the Makefile**:

  1. **Path to the ft_printf project**:
     ```makefile
     FT_PRINTF_PATH = <path_to_ft_printf_directory>
     ```

  2. **Link the libftprintf.a library**:
     ```makefile
     FT_PRINTF = $(FT_PRINTF_PATH)/libftprintf.a
     LIBS = -L$(FT_PRINTF_PATH) -lft
     ```

  3. **Compile the project and link with ft_printf**:
     ```makefile
     $(NAME): $(OBJ) $(FT_PRINTF)
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME) $(LIBS)
     ```

  4. **Ensure that ft_printf is compiled during the build process**:
     ```makefile
     $(FT_PRINTF):
         $(MAKE) -C $(FT_PRINTF_PATH)
     ```

  5. **Clean up object files**:
     ```makefile
     clean:
         rm -f $(OBJ)
         $(MAKE) -C $(FT_PRINTF_PATH) clean
     ```

  6. **Clean up everything (object files, executables, and libftprintf.a)**:
     ```makefile
     fclean: clean
         rm -f $(NAME)
         $(MAKE) -C $(FT_PRINTF_PATH) fclean
     ```

**Example of Makefile**:
```bash
CC = cc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror
OPTIONS = -c

# Path to the ft_printf project
FT_PRINTF_PATH = ./ft_printf

# Source files for your project
SRC = main.c

# Object files for your project
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)

# Final executable name
NAME = my_project

# Link the libftprintf.a library
FT_PRINTF = $(FT_PRINTF_PATH)/libftprintf.a
LIBS = -L$(FT_PRINTF_PATH) -lftprintf

# All: Compile both ft_printf and your project
all: $(NAME)

$(NAME): $(OBJ) $(FT_PRINTF)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME) $(LIBS)

# Compile .c files to .o object files
%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OPTIONS) $< -o $@

# Ensure that ft_printf is compiled during the build process
$(FT_PRINTF):
	$(MAKE) -C $(FT_PRINTF_PATH)

# Clean up object files
clean:
	rm -f $(OBJ)
	$(MAKE) -C $(FT_PRINTF_PATH) clean

# Clean up everything (object files, executables, and libftprintf.a)
fclean: clean
	rm -f $(NAME)
	$(MAKE) -C $(FT_PRINTF_PATH) fclean

# Rebuild everything (clean and then compile both ft_printf and your project)
re: fclean all

.PHONY: all clean fclean re
```
